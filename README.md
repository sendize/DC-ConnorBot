# Connor Discord Bot
Trying to code a Discord bot using RougeException's <a href="https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net">Discord.NET</a> and with the help of the tutorials from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmfZ6FWTHZjPrPP3dWQ1bHg">Peter</a>.

As of now, it can only do these:

* <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/home"> Osu! </a> integration using XFerno2's <a href="https://github.com/Xferno2/CSharpOsu">CSharpOsu</a>.
* Stream local mp3 audio.
* Basic interaction when mentioned and some triggers.
